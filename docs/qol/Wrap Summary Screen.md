# Wrapping Summary Screen
In XY and later games, the Summary Screen wraps around. By that I mean if you press down on the summary screen of the 
last Pokémon in your party, you'll be taken back to the first Pokémon in your party (in earlier games, it would just do 
nothing). Similarly, if you press up while on the first Pokémon in your party, you'll go to the last.
